The procedure is divided into three parts:
1. Feature Extraction
2. Image Stitching
3. Orientation estimation

## Feature Extraction
This step involves extracting features from the images to locate shared points and determine which images must be stiched together and how.

## Image Stitching
This step involves the actual stitching

## Orientation Estimation
Given the image returned by the previous step we proceed to approximate the orientation of each image.
